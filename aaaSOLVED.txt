Answered questions
1) When I call nrePhotopigmentsExcitationsCMosaicWithNoEyeMovements.m, I got a warning:Warning: "The optical image resolution (4.20 microns) is too low relative to the cone aperture (3.36 microns) for accurate computation of cone blur. Skipping blur by cone aperture. Consider increasing the # of pixels in the stimulus or decrease the stimulus FOV." What is a reasonable value for # of pixels? 
	DHB: reduce the field of view instead of increase #pixels. Add a comment explaining the choice of small field of view is just for the purpose of this tutorial, and they have other options.

Fixed bugs
1) t_modulatedGratingsSceneGeneration.m
Stimulus #5: the original stimulus was out of the display gamut.
To fix it, I added customGratingParams.warningInsteadOfErrorOnOutOfGamut = true;
Or I could reduce the 'conContrastModulation' to lower values (e.g., [0.1, 0.1, -0.1])
	DHB: Make it as high as you can within gamut.
	FH: Done.

2) there is a bug in t_NWay_OneStimPerTrial.m (can't run). The bug is it calls computeThresholdNWay_OneStimulusPerTrial -> computePerformanceNWay_OneStimulusPerTrial -> combineContainersMat. It breaks at the last step because the input is only for 1 frame of a stimulus (i.e., dimension < 3). To fix it, we could either add temporalModulation as a varargin or replace createGratingScene with sceGrating.
	DHB: If we can make this work by special casing 2D inputs to treat them as one frame, that would be best. We think
	this problem arises because Matlab now squeezes trailing singleton dimensions of matrices, for better or worse.
	FH: this bug has been fixed by using nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaicWithNoEyeMovements.m instead of nrePhotopigmentExcitationsConeMosaicHexWithNoEyeMovements.m. I guess the former returns a 3-d matrix (#trials x #timeSamples x #cones).
	There are some other bugs in the code (e.g., in computeThresholdNWay_OneStimulusPerTrial.m, I added line 119-123). The code can run now, but it seems like it's stuck in a weird loop. More debugging is required.
	DHB: rename t_NWay_OneStimPerTrial.m -> t_NWay_OneStimulusPerTrial.m
	FH: I reduced the fovDegs, fixed some bugs in handling the quest method (e.g., lines 113 - 202). I also changed the threshold criterion for different NWay-1stimulus task, and also fixed the plot.

Merging
1) There are a lot of versions of different nre's that use the cMosaic.  Rationalize.  Perhaps all the specific ones should be implemented as calls into the most general one?

nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaicWithNoEyeMovements.m: why do we need to compute the OIsequence at all time samples even though only the oi of the first frame is used (line 209-250)? Size of theNeuralResponses(noiseFlags{idx}) = #trials x #timeSamples x #cones

nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaic.m: Size of theNeuralResponses(noiseFlags{idx}) = #trials x #timeSamples x #cones. All the oiSequence is passed into theConeMosaic.compute function unlike the function above. nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaicWithNoEyeMovements.m is more like a special case, and it's suitable when the optical image does not differ across all time samples. 

nrePhotopigmentExcitationsSingleShot.m: Size of theNeuralResponses(noiseFlags{idx}) = #trials x 1 x #cones. This can totally be replaced by nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaic.m without even specifying there is only one frame.

DHB: change the comments in nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaicSingleShot.m, nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaicWithNoEyeMovements.m to describe what they do, and to indicate that they are special cases of nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaic.m; keep the first two functions, but when called, direct to nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaic.m (backward compatibility) and +error message ('this is a better way to call the function ... ). Add a check that the oiSequence satisfies that either it has one frame or all the frames are the same (oiGet(oi, 'photons') returns 3d matrix).  

FH: I had to change one of the properties ('neuralComputeFunction') in the neuralResponseEngine.m, otherwise I couldn't make the switch to nrePhotopigmentExcitationsCmosaic.m if the other two functions are called. 
Validation: 
I tested calling ...SingleShot.m & ...WithNoEyeMovements.m and then either sticking with the deprecated function (responded 'no') or switching to ...Cmosaic.m. I compared the measured contrast sensitivities for several spatial frequencies. They matched.
