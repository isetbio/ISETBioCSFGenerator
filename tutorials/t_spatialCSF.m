% Compute spatial CSF in different color directions
%
% Description:
%    Use ISETBioCSFGenerator to run out CSFs in different color directions.
%    This example uses an ideal Poisson TAFC observer and circularly
%    windowed gratings of constant size.

% of L, M, S cone contrast.  These vectors get normalized below, so only
% their direction matters in the specification.

% Set the RMS cone contrast of the stimulus. Things may go badly if you
% exceed the gamut of the monitor, so we are conservative and set this at a
% value that is within gamut of typical monitors and don't worry about it
% further for this tutorial.  A vector length contrast of 0.08 should be
% OK.

% noise, and includes optical blur.

% PoissonTAFC makes decision by performing the Poisson likelihood ratio test
% Also set up parameters associated with use of this classifier.

%% Parameters for threshold estimation/quest engine
% The actual threshold varies enough with the different engines that we
% need to adjust the contrast range that Quest+ searches over, as well as
% the range of psychometric function slopes. Threshold limits are computed
% as 10^-logThreshLimitVal.  The reason it is log units is that below we
% define the PF for the questEngine as @qpPFWeibullLog. Had we used the
% default (@qpPFWeibull), the units would have been dB.
%
% Also note explicit passing of proportion correct criterion for threshold.
% The default value of 0.81606 matches the parameterization of mQUESTPlus'
% Weibull PFs, when lapse rate is 0 and guess rate is 0.5.  But it seems
% better to pass it explicitly so we know what it is. Keeping 0.81606 for
% backward compatibilty.
%
% There are two separate structures below. The conceptual distinction
% between them is not entirely clear.  These are interpretted by
% computeThresholdTAFC.

% See t_thresholdEngine.m for more on options of the two different mode of
% operation (fixed numer of trials vs. adaptive)
