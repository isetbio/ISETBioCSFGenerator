1) The transition from coneMosaicHex is not complete.  We need to ablate this from the main thread.

To find what needs to be done, global search on ConeMosaicHex will get you most of them.

=================================================================================================
Notes (need further discussion before making any changes)
1) computeFunctions/scene/sceGrating.m
There is a helper function inside this function, called generatePresentationDisplay. It assumes a default screen display 'LCD-Apple', which cannot be changed. Perhaps we can add a field 'screenDisplay' to the struct gratingParams to have more flexibility.
	DHB: Yes, good.  Make default 'LCD-Apple' so the default behavior is unchanged.
	FH: Done. Need to double check if all the tutorials make the corresponding changes.

4) computeThresholdTAFC calls a function called spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m when the inference engine needs to compute a template. The computation in the function is the same when we choose either 'linear' or 'quadratureEnergy'. It's not needed to get the template for phase-shifted stimuli when 'linear' is selected, so we can edit spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m to speed up things a bit for the linear template. 
	DHB: perhaps we can.

5) if we set 'visualizeAllComponents' to be true when calling computePerformanceTAFC.m, then we can visualize the plot for cone responses. Perhaps we can also add a plotting function to visualize the trained classifier (line 131-133; theClassifierEngine.trainedClassifier) when 'visualizeAllComponents' is set to true. 
	DHB: perhaps we can.

6) when we compute templates by calling spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m, it first computes the noise-free cone responses (size = 1 x #timeSamples x #cones), and then it selects the last time sample as the template. This could be problematic if someone creates a temporally modulated stimulus. 
	DHB: post the question to Nicolas.

7) @DHB: document quest 'blockedVal'

8) Figure out quest engine stopping rule and document (find out where minTrial & maxTrial is used)
	FH: questThresholdEngine.m, contrastThresholdEngine.m

9) Perhaps we can add a tutorial to work through how to visualize cone excitations, templates, classifiers and etc without having to do it within computeThreshold.m? If we do it within the function, that would generate so many figures and slowing down the computation. 


Questions
1) How is the level of contrast determined given the range of slope and threshold? It is not super clear how that's derived. 
Observation 1: In classifierEngine, when defining classifier parameters, 'nTest' means the number of test trials for each given contrast level. 
Observation 2: When defining questEnginePara, the number of contrast level is largely affected by how fine estDomain & slopeRange are (with 'nTest' being fixed).
Observation 3: When estDomain & slopeRange are fixed, 'nTest' also affects the number of test contrast levels.

2) In spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m, why is the difference of cone responses (test-null) then multiplied by a Gaussian envelope to make a template? This script needs more comments.
	FH: after subtracting the cone responses given the null stimulus, the differences look like a sinusoidal grating without a window, that's why a Gaussian envelope is then multiplied. This is not described in the paper though, and what if the envelope of the stimulus is not Gaussian? Also, why first interpolate from cones to grids, and then back to cones, again?

3) why do we have a separate engine (contrastThresholdEngine.m) for min max trials? Can we merge contrastThresholdEngine.m and questThresholdEngine.m? There are two methods in contrastThresholdEngine.m, but they don't seem to be ever used.
