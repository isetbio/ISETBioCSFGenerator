1) The transition from coneMosaicHex is not complete.  We need to ablate this from the main thread.

To find what needs to be done, global search on ConeMosaicHex will get you most of them.

2) Can we delete ComputeParameterThreshold.m?

3) There are a lot of versions of different nre's that use the cMosaic.  Rationalize.  Perhaps all the specific ones should be implemented as calls into the most general one?

4) Similarly, we need to think about whether we need both TAFC versions of various stuff and the NWay_OneStimulusPerTrial.  Can we make the TAFC versions calls into the NWay_OneSTimulusPerTrial?
