1) The transition from coneMosaicHex is not complete.  We need to ablate this from the main thread.

To find what needs to be done, global search on ConeMosaicHex will get you most of them.

2) Can we delete ComputeParameterThreshold.m?

3) Similarly, we need to think about whether we need both TAFC versions of various stuff and the NWay_OneStimulusPerTrial.  Can we make the TAFC versions calls into the NWay_OneSTimulusPerTrial?

=================================================================================================
Notes (need further discussion before making any changes)
1) computeFunctions/scene/sceGrating.m
There is a helper function inside this function, called generatePresentationDisplay. It assumes a default screen display 'LCD-Apple', which cannot be changed. Perhaps we can add a field 'screenDisplay' to the struct gratingParams to have more flexibility.
	DHB: Yes, good.  Make default 'LCD-Apple' so the default behavior is unchanged.
	FH: Done.

4) computeThresholdTAFC calls a function called spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m when the inference engine needs to compute a template. The computation in the function is the same when we choose either 'linear' or 'quadratureEnergy'. It's not needed to get the template for phase-shifted stimuli when 'linear' is selected, so we can edit spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m to speed up things a bit for the linear template. 
	DHB: perhaps we can.

5) if we set 'visualizeAllComponents' to be true when calling computePerformanceTAFC.m, then we can visualize the plot for cone responses. Perhaps we can also add a plotting function to visualize the trained classifier (line 131-133; theClassifierEngine.trainedClassifier) when 'visualizeAllComponents' is set to true. 
	DHB: perhaps we can.

6) when we compute templates by calling spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m, it first computes the noise-free cone responses (size = 1 x #timeSamples x #cones), and then it selects the last time sample as the template. This could be problematic if someone creates a temporally modulated stimulus. 
	DHB: post the question to Nicolas.

7) @DHB: document quest 'blockedVal'

8) Figure out quest engine stopping rule and document (find out where minTrial & maxTrial is used)


Questions
1) I thought that there is only one classifier that segregates the responses to all null stimuli and the responses to all test stimuli, but I think this understanding is not correct. Based on the code, there is one classifier for every level of contrast. Should there be N classifiers where N denotes the number of contrast, or just one single classifier?

2) How is the level of contrast determined given the range of slope and threshold? It is not super clear how that's derived.

3) In spatioTemporalPoolingWeights.m, why is the de-meaned cone responses then multiplied by a Gaussian envelope to make a template?
